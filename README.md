## About Nostr:

NOSTR is an acronym meaning "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted through Relays". 

Nostr is an open protocol for exchanging simple, structured information. This happens publicly through relays your client(s) are connected to. With Nostr, you cannot be de-platformed, and you are not fed an algorithm by default.

You also have freedom to use whichever clients you prefer to interface with.

## About Jam:

Jam is an open source alternative to Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces and similar audio spaces.

With Jam you can create audio rooms that can be used for panel discussions, jam sessions, free flowing conversations, debates, theatre plays, musicals and more. The only limit is your imagination.
